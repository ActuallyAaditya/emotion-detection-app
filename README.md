This Python project focuses on detecting emotions in text, categorizing them as positive, negative or neutral sentiment. The project leverages machine learning algorithms like NLP to perform sentiment analysis of textual data. Then, the visualization of the data is done to display the results, making it easier to interpret the emotional tone of the data entered. Tkinter GUI is used to create a good looking GUI application of this Python Project. This can be applied to social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.
